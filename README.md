[Download from Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/forceport)

A mod that forces the port to always be the same when using the "Open To LAN" feature!

*Client-side only!*

*The configuration menu on recent Minecraft versions*

# Usage
Force Port allows you to modify the default port used when opening your world to LAN. This is useful for those who want to use a specific port for their server.

Just go to the installation location for that Minecraft instance, and open the `config` folder. You should see a file called `forceport.txt`. Open it with a text editor and change the port to your desired port.
